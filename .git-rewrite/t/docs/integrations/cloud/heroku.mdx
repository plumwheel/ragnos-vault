## Instructions

### Step 1: Open the integrations console

Open the Infisical Dashboard. Choose the project in which you want to set up the intergation. Go to the integrations tab in the left sidebar.

### Step 2: Authenticate with Heroku

Click on "Heroku" tile. Log in if required and provide the necessary permissions to Infisical. You will afterwards be redirected back to the integrations page.

Note: during an integration with Heroku, for security reasons, it is impossible to maintain end-to-end encryption. In theory, this lets Infisical decrypt yor environment variables. In practice, we can assure you that this will never be done, and it allows us to protect your secrets from bad actors online. With any questions, reach out support@infisical.com.

### Step 3: Start integration

Choose a Heroku App that you want to sync the secrets to, and the Infisical project environment that you want to sync the secrets from. Start the integration.

The integration should now show status 'In Sync'. Every time you edit secrets, they will be automatically pushed to Heroku. 

<Info> 
  If you need to update your integration, you will have to delete the current one and create a new one.
