## Problem with SMTP

If you opt for actual SMTP server (not the local MailHog), you have to have the right environment variables set.

You can normally populate `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` with your usual login and password (you could also create a 'burner' email). Sometimes, there still are problems.

You can go to your Gmail account settings > security and enable “less secure apps”. This would allow Infisical to use your Gmail to send emails.

If it still doesn't work, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72547853/unable-to-send-email-in-c-sharp-less-secure-app-access-not-longer-available/72553362#72553362) should help.

## `MONGO_URL` issues

Your `MONGO_URL` should be something like `mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/?authSource=admin`. If you want to change it (not recommended), you should make sure that you keep this URL in line with `MONGO_USERNAME=root` and `MONGO_PASSWORD=example`.
