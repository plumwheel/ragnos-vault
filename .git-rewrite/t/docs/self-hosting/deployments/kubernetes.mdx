<Info>
Self-host vs. Infisical Cloud

Self-hosting Infisical means managing the service yourself, taking care of upgrades, scaling, security, etc.

If you're less technical and looking for a hands-free experience with minimal overhead then we recommend Infisical Cloud.

</Info>

**Prerequisites**
- You have understanding of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- You have understanding of [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) 
- You have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) installed and connected to your kubernetes cluster


#### 1. Fill our environment variables

Before you can deploy the Helm chart, you must fill out the required environment variables. To do so, please either download or copy the
contents of [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/helm-charts/infisical/values.yaml) to a `.yaml` file. 
_Refer to the available [environment variables](../../self-hosting/configuration/envars)_

Once you have a local copy of the values file, fill our the required environment variables and save the file.


#### 2. Install Infisical Helm repository 

```bash
helm repo add infisical-helm-charts 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/helm-charts/helm/charts/' 
  
helm repo update
```

#### 3. Install the Helm chart 

By default, the helm chart will be installed on your default namespace. If you wish to install the Chart on a different namespace, you may specify
that by adding the `--namespace <namespace-to-install-to>` to your `helm install` command.

```bash
## Installs to default namespace
helm install infisical-helm-charts/infisical --values <path to the values.yaml you downloaded/created in step 2>
```

<Note>
If you have not filled out all of the required environment variables, you will see an error message prompting you to 
do so. 
</Note>

4. Your Infisical installation is complete and should be running on the host name you specified in Ingress in `values.yaml`.
Note: Please allow an additional time (2 minutes) for the frontend pods to be fully ready.
