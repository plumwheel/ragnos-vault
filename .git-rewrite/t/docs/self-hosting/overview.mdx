Self-host vs. Infisical Cloud

Self-hosting Infisical means managing the service yourself, taking care of upgrades, scaling, security, etc.

If you're less technical and looking for a hands-free experience with minimal overhead then we recommend Infisical Cloud.

Infisical Cloud also comes with some extra features unavailable in the self-hosted edition. You can find more information about Infisical Cloud's offering on the pricing page.

## Deployment options

Infisical can be deployed on a Linux VM with docker-compose and Kubernetes. We're rolling out more specific deployment options for DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, and Azure soon.

## Telemetry

Infisical collects telemetry data about general usage.

The data helps us understand how the product is doing and guide our product development to create the best possible platform; it also helps us demonstrate growth for investors as we support Infisical as open-source software.

To opt out of telemetry, you can set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` within the [environment variables](./configuration/envars).
