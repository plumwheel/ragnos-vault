# RAGnos Vault M2 Strategic Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on GPT-5 strategic consultation, this plan prioritizes **security-first with commercial viability** to deliver a production-ready supply chain for plugin distribution. The approach uses parallel streams with clear dependencies to maximize velocity while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

**Core Strategy**: Build end-to-end verification with tough/Rust client + temporary local signing to prove trust flow, then swap in AWS KMS for production-grade signing.

## 1. Implementation Phases

### Phase A: TUF Repository Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish working TUF repository with temporary signing
**Critical Path**: Blocks all other client-side work

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket with versioning and Object Lock
- [ ] Configure CloudFront with proper cache policies
- [ ] Implement TUF repository builder with local signing
- [ ] Create initial metadata structure (root, targets, delegations)
- [ ] Deploy staging repository with sample plugins
- [ ] Implement basic publication pipeline

**Deliverables**:
- Staging TUF repository live on S3/CloudFront
- Sample plugin downloadable with TUF metadata
- Root keys pinned for client bootstrap
- Publication CI pipeline functional

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Use temporary local signing to unblock development
- Implement proper cache invalidation for timestamp/snapshot
- Test negative cases: expired timestamp, tampered targets

### Phase B: Client-Side Verification (Week 1-2, parallel with A)
**Goal**: Integrate tough/Rust client into runtime loader
**Critical Path**: Core verification functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Evaluate tough/Rust TUF client integration
- [ ] Implement TUF client wrapper in runtime loader
- [ ] Add metadata verification before plugin loading
- [ ] Implement rollback/freeze attack protection
- [ ] Create comprehensive negative test suite
- [ ] Integrate with existing policy engine

**Deliverables**:
- Runtime loader verifies plugins via TUF
- Comprehensive test coverage for attack scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for verification overhead
- Error handling and fallback strategies

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Spike tough integration early (2-3 days max)
- Have fallback plan for crypto compatibility issues
- Implement strict timeout and error boundaries

### Phase C: AWS KMS Production Signing (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Replace local signing with enterprise-grade KMS
**Dependencies**: Requires Phase A staging repo

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Provision AWS KMS keys (ECDSA P-256 preferred)
- [ ] Implement tough signer integration with KMS
- [ ] Configure IAM policies and key access controls
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
- [ ] Implement key rotation procedures
- [ ] Document offline root key ceremony

**Deliverables**:
- Production KMS signing pipeline
- Key rotation and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting for key usage
- Security audit documentation

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **CRITICAL**: Test ECDSA P-256 compatibility early
- Fallback to RSA-3072 if P-256 issues found
- Implement threshold signing for critical roles
- Document break-glass procedures

### Phase D: Secure Auto-Installer (Week 2-3, starts after B)
**Goal**: Build installation system with --ignore-scripts
**Dependencies**: Requires Phase B client verification

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design atomic installation workflow
- [ ] Implement tarball extraction with permission controls
- [ ] Add --ignore-scripts enforcement (security critical)
- [ ] Create rollback mechanisms for failed installs
- [ ] Add dry-run verification mode
- [ ] Integrate with capability system

**Deliverables**:
- Secure plugin installer CLI/library
- Atomic install with rollback capability
- Documentation and migration guides
- Integration with runtime loader

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Never execute package install scripts by default
- Implement strict filesystem permissions
- Test rollback scenarios thoroughly
- Provide migration path for existing plugins

### Phase E: SBOM Generation and Publication (Week 3, parallel)
**Goal**: Generate and publish CycloneDX SBOMs via TUF
**Dependencies**: Benefits from Phase A repo but can start now

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate CycloneDX generation into CI
- [ ] Publish SBOMs as TUF targets
- [ ] Link SBOM digests in plugin metadata

- SBOMs available via TUF trust chain
- Integration with security scanning tools
- Documentation for consumers

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Compress SBOMs to minimize size impact
- Use immutable URLs with long cache times
- Implement SBOM validation in client

### Phase F: Production Hardening (Week 3-4, ongoing)
**Goal**: Production readiness and operational excellence
**Dependencies**: Requires core functionality from A-D

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive monitoring
- [ ] Create operational runbooks and playbooks
- [ ] Conduct security penetration testing
- [ ] Perform disaster recovery drills
- [ ] Document SLAs and incident procedures
- [ ] Create customer onboarding materials
