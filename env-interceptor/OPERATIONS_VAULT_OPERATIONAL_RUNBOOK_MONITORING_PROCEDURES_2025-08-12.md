node test-performance-benchmarking.js
```

## Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Core Performance Metrics**:
- Vault Hit Rate: Should match canary percentage ¬±10%
- Error Rate: Must remain at 0% (any errors trigger investigation)
- Access Latency: <5ms per secret access
- Memory Usage: <10MB additional overhead

**Operational Metrics**:
- Total Secret Accesses: Track usage patterns
- Cache Hit Rate: Should be >50% for frequently accessed secrets
- Fallback Rate: Environment fallback usage (should decrease over time)

### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

**Sample Statistics Output**:
```json
{
  "requests": 1250,
  "vault_hits": 312,
  "env_fallbacks": 938,
  "errors": 0,
  "cache_hits": 156,
  "kill_switch_active": false,
  "vault_hit_rate": "24.96%",
  "cache_effectiveness": "2.8x speedup"
}
```

**Alerts Configuration**:
- üî¥ **Critical**: Error rate >0% (immediate response required)
- üü° **Warning**: Vault hit rate deviates >15% from target canary
- üü° **Warning**: Cache effectiveness <2x speedup
- üîµ **Info**: Total accesses exceed baseline by >50%

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations

**Morning Health Check** (5 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Verify all MCP servers running with vault integration
ps aux | grep "vault-env-preloader"

# 2. Check recent error rates (should be 0)
tail -100 /var/log/vault-interceptor.log | grep ERROR

# 3. Validate current hit rates match configuration
curl -s http://monitoring-endpoint/vault-metrics | jq '.vault_hit_rate'

# 4. Performance spot check
node test-performance-benchmarking.js --quick
```

**Daily Metrics Review**:
- Total secret accesses in last 24h
- Average hit rate vs canary target
- Any kill switch activations (investigate if any)
- Memory and performance trends

### Weekly Operations

**Security Validation** (15 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Run security test suite
node test-security-validation.js

# 2. Verify secret redaction still working
grep -r "hf_" /var/log/ --include="*.log" | wc -l  # Should be 0

# 3. Test kill switch functionality in staging
VAULT_MODE=vault VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true node test-kill-switch-staging.js
```

**Performance Review**:
- Trend analysis on access latencies
- Cache effectiveness over time
- Memory usage patterns
- Any performance regression detection

### Monthly Operations

**Comprehensive Validation** (30 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Full test suite execution
npm run test:all

# 2. Staging deployment test
node staging-deployment-test.js

# 3. Update canary percentages if needed
# Review production metrics and adjust rollout strategy
```

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update operational metrics baselines
- Review and update emergency procedures
- Validate runbook accuracy against current deployment

## Progressive Deployment Management

### Canary Percentage Adjustment

**Current Production Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mode": "dual",
  "canary_percent": 25,
  "vault_url": "http://vault.production:8200",
  "enable_kill_switch": true
}
```

**Safe Rollout Schedule**:
1. **Week 1-2**: 10% canary (validate basics)
2. **Week 3-4**: 25% canary (current production state)
3. **Week 5-6**: 50% canary (majority environment)
4. **Week 7-8**: 75% canary (primarily vault)  
5. **Week 9+**: 100% vault mode (environment becomes emergency fallback)

**Rollout Validation Criteria** (must meet all before increasing):
- ‚úÖ Zero error rate for 7+ consecutive days
- ‚úÖ Hit rate within ¬±5% of target canary percentage
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation (latency <5ms)
- ‚úÖ No kill switch activations
- ‚úÖ Cache effectiveness >2x

### Rollback Procedures

**Gradual Rollback** (Recommended):
```bash
# Step 1: Reduce canary percentage
export VAULT_CANARY_PERCENT=10  # From current 25%

# Step 2: Monitor for 24h, then proceed if stable
export VAULT_MODE=shadow  # Shadow mode for validation

# Step 3: Full environment fallback if needed
export VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true
```

**Emergency Rollback** (Production Issues):
```bash
# Immediate environment fallback - zero downtime
export VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true
export VAULT_EMERGENCY_FALLBACK=true

# Restart services to pick up new config
systemctl restart mcp-services
# or batch restart via orchestration tool
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Vault Hit Rate Too Low**
```
Symptom: vault_hit_rate showing 5% when target is 25%
Cause: Random number distribution variance or configuration error

Investigation:
1. Check VAULT_CANARY_PERCENT environment variable
2. Verify configuration file not overriding environment
3. Monitor over longer period (variance expected in small samples)

Resolution:
- If config correct: Monitor for 1+ hours (small sample variance)
- If config incorrect: Update and restart affected services
```

**Issue: High Error Rates**
```
Symptom: errors > 0 in statistics
Cause: Vault connectivity, authentication, or network issues

Investigation:
1. Check vault server connectivity: curl $VAULT_URL/v1/sys/health
2. Verify authentication token: vault auth -method=...
3. Network latency: ping vault-server

Resolution:
1. Fix vault connectivity issues
2. If cannot resolve quickly: Activate kill switch
3. After resolution: Gradually re-enable vault mode
```

**Issue: Performance Degradation**  
```
Symptom: Secret access latency >5ms consistently  
Cause: Vault network latency, cache misses, or resource contention

Investigation:
1. Run performance test: node test-performance-benchmarking.js
2. Check cache effectiveness in metrics
3. Monitor vault server resource usage
4. Network latency to vault server

Resolution:
1. Optimize cache TTL settings (increase from 5min default)
2. Scale vault infrastructure if needed
3. Consider regional vault deployment for latency
```

**Issue: Memory Leaks**
```
Symptom: Memory usage growing continuously >10MB overhead
Cause: Cache not being properly cleaned or memory leak in interceptor

Investigation:
1. Monitor cache size in statistics over time
2. Check for memory leaks: node --inspect vault-env-preloader.js
3. Review cache TTL settings and cleanup

Resolution:
1. Restart services to clear memory (temporary)
2. Adjust cache settings or implement more aggressive cleanup
3. Update to newer version if known memory leak
```

## Alerting and Incident Response

### Alert Severity Levels

**Critical (P0) - Immediate Response Required**:
- Error rate >0% for >5 minutes
- All vault accesses failing (100% fallback rate)  
- Kill switch activated automatically
- Memory usage >50MB (potential leak)

**High (P1) - Response within 30 minutes**:
- Vault hit rate deviates >20% from target for >1 hour
- Performance degradation >2x baseline
- Cache effectiveness drops below 1.5x

**Medium (P2) - Response within 4 hours**:  
- Vault hit rate deviates >10% from target for >4 hours
- Gradual performance degradation (1.5x baseline)
- Unusual access patterns detected

**Low (P3) - Response within 24 hours**:
- Minor performance variations
- Configuration drift notifications
- Routine maintenance alerts

### Incident Response Workflow

**P0/P1 Incident Response**:
1. **Immediate** (0-5 min): Activate kill switch if service degradation
2. **Assessment** (5-15 min): Run health checks, identify root cause  
3. **Resolution** (15-60 min): Fix underlying issue
4. **Validation** (60-90 min): Gradual re-enable, monitor recovery
5. **Post-Incident** (24h): Review, update procedures, prevent recurrence

**Communication Plan**:
- P0: Immediate notification to on-call team + management
- P1: Notification to on-call team, management within 30min
- P2+: Standard incident tracking, daily status updates

## Maintenance Windows

### Planned Maintenance Procedures

**Vault System Updates**:
```bash
# 1. Enable shadow mode (zero impact)
export VAULT_MODE=shadow

# 2. Deploy new version to staging
git pull origin main
npm install && npm run build
node staging-deployment-test.js

# 3. Rolling production update (if staging passes)
# Update one service at a time, validate, continue

# 4. Re-enable dual mode after validation
export VAULT_MODE=dual
```

**Vault Server Maintenance**:
- Coordinate with vault infrastructure team
- Activate kill switch before vault maintenance window
- Services automatically fallback to environment variables
- Re-enable vault mode after maintenance completion + validation
