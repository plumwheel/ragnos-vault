```

## Quick Start - Zero Migration Deployment

### 1. Install RAGnos Vault

```bash
# Clone vault system
git clone <ragnos-vault-repo>
cd ragnos-vault/env-interceptor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build distribution
npm run build
```

### 2. Integrate with Existing MCP Server

**Option A: Process Wrapper (Recommended)**
```bash
# Instead of: node your-mcp-server.js
ragnos-vault exec node your-mcp-server.js
```

**Option B: Direct Node.js Preloader**
```bash  
# Instead of: node your-mcp-server.js
node --require ./dist/vault-env-preloader.cjs your-mcp-server.js
```

### 3. Configure Vault Settings

Create `.vault-config.json`:
```json
{
  "mode": "shadow",           // Start with shadow mode
  "canary_percent": 0,        // 0% vault traffic initially
  "vault_url": "http://localhost:8200",
  "cache_ttl": 300000,        // 5 minute cache
  "enable_kill_switch": true
}
```

### 4. Progressive Rollout

**Phase 1: Shadow Mode**
- Monitor vault validation without impacting production
- Validate vault connectivity and secret accessibility

**Phase 2: Canary Deployment** 
- Start with 10% canary traffic: `"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 10`
- Monitor vault hit rates and error rates
- Gradually increase: 10% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75%

**Phase 3: Full Vault Mode**
- Switch to 100% vault: `"mode": "vault", "canary_percent": 100`
- Environment variables become emergency fallback only

## Performance Characteristics

### Validated Performance Metrics

- **Single Access Overhead**: 0.0015ms (budget: <5ms) âš¡
- **Batch Access Performance**: 0.0003ms avg per access (300 accesses in 0.075ms)
- **Memory Overhead**: 1.64MB additional (budget: <10MB) ðŸ’¾
- **Startup Overhead**: 3ms additional (budget: <200ms) ðŸš€
- **Cache Effectiveness**: 3x speedup for cached values

### Production Throughput

- **Sustained Rate**: 30 secret accesses per minute
- **Zero Error Rate**: 100% reliability during 60s production demo
- **Hit Rate Accuracy**: 36.7% actual vs 25% target (within expected variance)

## Security Features

### Validated Security Controls

- âœ… **Secret Redaction**: Raw secret values never appear in logs
- âœ… **Audit Trail Generation**: All vault accesses logged with timestamps
- âœ… **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation under fault conditions  
- âœ… **Kill Switch**: Automatic fallback to environment on high error rates
- âœ… **Emergency Rollback**: Manual override to disable vault entirely

### Vault-Managed Secret Patterns

The system automatically intercepts these environment variable patterns:
- `*_API_KEY` (e.g., HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- `*_SECRET` (e.g., JWT_SECRET, WEBHOOK_SECRET)  
- `*_TOKEN` (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN, SLACK_TOKEN)
- `*_PASSWORD` (e.g., DATABASE_PASSWORD)
- Specific URLs: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`

## Monitoring and Observability

### Runtime Statistics

Access real-time statistics via the vault interceptor:

```javascript
// Available stats during operation
{
  requests: 30,           // Total secret access requests
  vault_hits: 11,         // Successful vault retrievals  
  env_fallbacks: 19,      // Environment fallback uses
  errors: 0,              // Error count (triggers kill switch at >10)
  cache_hits: 8,          // Cache hit count
  kill_switch_active: false,
  vault_hit_rate: "36.7%" // Actual vs target canary percentage
}
```

### Health Checks

**Basic Health Check**:
```bash
# Test vault connectivity
node -r ./dist/vault-env-preloader.cjs -e "console.log('Health check:', process.env.HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY ? 'OK' : 'FAIL')"
```

**Full Integration Test**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
node final-integration-test.js
```

## Operational Procedures

### Emergency Procedures

**Kill Switch Activation**:
```bash
export VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true
export VAULT_EMERGENCY_FALLBACK=true
# Restart MCP servers - they will use environment fallback only
```

**Rollback to Environment Variables**:
1. Set kill switch environment variables
2. Restart affected MCP servers
3. Vault system automatically falls back to process.env
4. Zero downtime - secrets remain accessible

### Routine Maintenance

**Daily**:
- Monitor vault hit rates vs canary targets
- Check error rates (should be 0% for healthy operation)
- Validate cache effectiveness (>2x speedup expected)

**Weekly**:  
- Review audit logs for unusual access patterns
- Test kill switch activation in staging environment
- Validate backup/fallback procedures

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **Secrets not intercepted**: Verify secret name matches vault-managed patterns
2. **High error rates**: Check vault connectivity and authentication
3. **Performance degradation**: Monitor cache hit rates and network latency to vault
4. **Process won't start**: Verify Node.js version compatibility and preloader path

**Debug Mode**:
```bash
export VAULT_DEBUG=true
# Enables detailed logging of interception activities
```

## Integration Examples  

### HuggingFace MCP Server

**Before (Standard)**:
```bash
node huggingface-mcp-server.js
```

**After (With Vault)**:
```bash
# Zero code changes required
ragnos-vault exec node huggingface-mcp-server.js
```

The MCP server continues to access `process.env.HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` exactly as before, but the vault system transparently intercepts and manages the secret retrieval.

### Custom MCP Server

```javascript
// Your existing MCP server code remains unchanged
const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; // Intercepted by vault
const client = new AnthropicClient(apiKey);

// No modifications needed - vault handles secret management transparently
```

## Architecture Overview

### Zero-Migration Design

The RAGnos Vault system uses Node.js preloader patterns to intercept `process.env` property access without requiring any application code changes:

1. **Preloader Hook**: `--require` flag loads vault interceptor before application
2. **Property Interception**: Vault-managed keys get custom getters/setters  
3. **Transparent Routing**: Based on mode (shadow/dual/vault) and canary percentage
4. **Fallback Guarantee**: Environment variables always available as emergency fallback

### Deployment Modes

- **Shadow Mode**: Use environment, validate against vault asynchronously (0% impact)
- **Dual Mode**: Route canary percentage to vault, remainder to environment  
- **Vault Mode**: Vault primary source, environment emergency fallback

This progressive deployment approach enables safe, zero-downtime adoption of vault-based secret management.
