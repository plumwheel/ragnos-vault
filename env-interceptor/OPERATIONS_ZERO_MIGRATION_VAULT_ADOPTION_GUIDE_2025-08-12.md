# Zero-Migration Vault Adoption Guide for MCP Servers

## Complete MCP Server Integration Without Code Changes

**Target Audience**: MCP Server developers and DevOps teams  
**Time to Deploy**: 5-15 minutes per MCP server  
**Code Changes Required**: **ZERO** ✨

## Overview

The RAGnos Vault Environment Interception System enables any existing MCP server to adopt vault-based secret management without modifying a single line of application code. Using Node.js preloader patterns, the system transparently intercepts `process.env` property access and routes secret retrieval through vault.

## Adoption Workflow

### Prerequisites Check

**Verify Compatibility**:
```bash
# Node.js version check (requires Node.js 14+)
node --version  # Should show v14+ or higher

# Verify MCP server currently works with environment variables
YOUR_SECRET_KEY=test-value node your-mcp-server.js
```

**System Requirements**:
- Node.js 14+ (tested with v16, v18, v20, v22)
- Existing MCP server using `process.env` for secrets
- Vault server accessible from deployment environment

### Step 1: Install RAGnos Vault (2 minutes)

```bash
# Option A: Direct deployment
git clone https://github.com/ragnos/vault-env-interceptor.git
cd vault-env-interceptor
npm install && npm run build

# Option B: NPM package (when published)
npm install @ragnos/vault-env-interceptor
```

### Step 2: Identify Secrets to Vault-Manage (1 minute)

The system automatically intercepts these patterns:
- `*_API_KEY` (HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- `*_SECRET` (JWT_SECRET, WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- `*_TOKEN` (GITHUB_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN)
- `*_PASSWORD` (DATABASE_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD)
- Database URLs: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`

**Inventory Check**:
```bash
# List vault-managed environment variables in your MCP server
env | grep -E "(API_KEY|SECRET|TOKEN|PASSWORD|_URL)$"
```

### Step 3: Configure Vault Settings (2 minutes)

Create `.vault-config.json` in your MCP server directory:

```json
{
  "mode": "shadow",           
  "canary_percent": 0,        
  "vault_url": "http://localhost:8200",
  "vault_token": "your-vault-token",
  "cache_ttl": 300000,        
  "enable_kill_switch": true,
  "debug": false
}
```

**Configuration Modes**:
- **Shadow**: Use environment vars, validate against vault (0% impact)
- **Dual**: Route canary % to vault, rest to environment
- **Vault**: Vault primary, environment emergency fallback

### Step 4: Deploy with Zero Code Changes (30 seconds)

**Before (your current command)**:
```bash
node your-mcp-server.js
```

**After (with vault integration)**:
```bash
# Option A: Process wrapper (recommended)
ragnos-vault exec node your-mcp-server.js

# Option B: Node.js preloader
node --require ./vault-env-preloader.js your-mcp-server.js
```

**That's it!** Your MCP server now has vault integration with zero code modifications.

### Step 5: Validate Integration (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test that your MCP server still works normally
ragnos-vault exec node your-mcp-server.js

# Check integration logs (should see vault interceptor messages)
tail -f logs/vault-interceptor.log

# Verify secrets still accessible to your application
# Your MCP server should function exactly as before
```

## Progressive Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode Validation (Week 1)
**Configuration**: `"mode": "shadow", "canary_percent": 0`
- MCP server uses environment variables (no change in behavior)
- Vault system validates secrets asynchronously
- Monitor for vault connectivity issues
- Zero production impact

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Check shadow mode working
grep "Shadow mode" logs/vault.log

# Verify no errors in shadow validation
grep "MISMATCH" logs/vault.log  # Should be empty

# Confirm MCP server functions normally
your-mcp-server-health-check
```

### Phase 2: Canary Deployment (Week 2-4)
**Configuration**: `"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 10`
- 10% of secret accesses route to vault
- 90% remain on environment variables
- Monitor vault hit rates and error rates

**Progressive Increase**:
```bash
# Week 2: 10% canary
echo '{"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 10, ...}' > .vault-config.json

# Week 3: 25% canary (if Week 2 successful)
echo '{"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 25, ...}' > .vault-config.json

# Week 4: 50% canary (if Week 3 successful)  
echo '{"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 50, ...}' > .vault-config.json
```

### Phase 3: Full Vault Mode (Week 5+)
**Configuration**: `"mode": "vault", "canary_percent": 100`
- All secrets retrieved from vault
- Environment variables become emergency fallback
- Complete vault adoption achieved

## Real-World Integration Examples

### HuggingFace MCP Server

**Original server.js** (no changes needed):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { HfInference } = require('@huggingface/inference');

// This line never changes - vault transparently intercepts
const hf = new HfInference(process.env.HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY);

app.listen(3000);
```

**New deployment command**:
```bash
# Instead of: node server.js
ragnos-vault exec node server.js
```

**Result**: HuggingFace MCP server now retrieves API keys from vault with zero code changes.

### Multi-Service MCP Server

**Original server.js** (no changes needed):
```javascript
// All these environment accesses automatically intercepted
const anthropicKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
const openaiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;  
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const redisUrl = process.env.REDIS_URL;

// Your existing business logic remains unchanged
```

**New deployment**:
```bash
ragnos-vault exec node server.js
```

**Result**: All secrets (Anthropic, OpenAI, database, Redis) managed by vault transparently.

### Docker Integration

**Original Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "mcp-server.js"]
```

**Updated Dockerfile** (minimal change):
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
COPY . .
RUN npm install

# Install vault interceptor
RUN npm install @ragnos/vault-env-interceptor

# Change only the CMD line
CMD ["ragnos-vault", "exec", "node", "mcp-server.js"]
```

### Kubernetes Integration

**Original deployment.yaml**:
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mcp-server
    command: ["node", "mcp-server.js"]
```

**Updated deployment.yaml**:
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mcp-server  
    command: ["ragnos-vault", "exec", "node", "mcp-server.js"]
    # Add vault configuration
    env:
    - name: VAULT_MODE
      value: "dual"
    - name: VAULT_CANARY_PERCENT  
      value: "25"
```

## Monitoring Integration Success

### Real-Time Statistics

Access integration statistics via the vault system:
```bash
# View current statistics  
curl localhost:8080/vault/stats  # If metrics endpoint enabled

# Or check logs
tail -f logs/vault-interceptor.log | grep "Statistics"
```

**Sample Statistics Output**:
```json
{
  "total_requests": 1250,
  "vault_hits": 312,
  "env_fallbacks": 938, 
  "errors": 0,
  "vault_hit_rate": "24.96%",
  "target_canary": "25%",
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Success Validation Checklist

- ✅ Performance unchanged

**Week 2-4 (Canary Deployment)**:
- ✅ Vault hit rate matches canary percentage ±5%
- ✅ Zero error rate maintained
- ✅ MCP server performance within 5ms baseline
- ✅ No kill switch activations

**Week 5+ (Full Vault)**:
- ✅ 95%+ vault hit rate achieved
- ✅ Sub-5ms secret access latency
- ✅ Emergency fallback tested and working
- ✅ Complete vault adoption validated

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: MCP Server Won't Start
```
Error: Cannot find module './vault-env-preloader.js'

Solution:
1. Verify vault interceptor installed: ls node_modules/@ragnos/vault-env-interceptor
2. Check path in command: use absolute path if needed
3. Ensure build completed: npm run build in vault directory
```

### Issue: Secrets Not Being Intercepted
```
Symptom: Vault hit rate remains 0% even in dual mode

Solution:  
1. Check secret names match patterns: *_API_KEY, *_SECRET, etc.
2. Verify configuration file loaded: check debug logs
3. Test with known pattern: HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=test ragnos-vault exec node -e "console.log(process.env.HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY)"
```

### Issue: Performance Degradation
```
Symptom: MCP server response time increased significantly

Solution:
1. Check vault network latency: ping vault-server
2. Monitor cache effectiveness in statistics
3. Temporarily activate kill switch if critical: export VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true
```

### Issue: Vault Connectivity Problems
```
Symptom: High error rates in statistics, fallback to environment

Solution:
1. Test vault connectivity: curl $VAULT_URL/v1/sys/health  
2. Verify authentication: vault auth -method=...
3. System automatically falls back to environment (zero downtime)
4. Fix vault issues, then disable kill switch to resume
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (Immediate)
```bash
# Activate kill switch - immediate environment fallback
export VAULT_KILL_SWITCH=true
export VAULT_EMERGENCY_FALLBACK=true

# Restart MCP server - will use environment variables only
systemctl restart your-mcp-service
```

### Gradual Rollback (Planned)
```bash
# Step 1: Reduce canary percentage
echo '{"mode": "dual", "canary_percent": 10, ...}' > .vault-config.json

# Step 2: Switch to shadow mode  
echo '{"mode": "shadow", "canary_percent": 0, ...}' > .vault-config.json

# Step 3: Remove vault integration entirely
# Change deployment back to: node your-mcp-server.js
```

### Rollback Validation
```bash
# Verify MCP server working on environment variables
YOUR_SECRET_KEY=test-value node your-mcp-server.js

# Check no vault dependencies remain
ldd your-mcp-binary | grep -i vault  # Should be empty

# Confirm normal operation resumed
your-mcp-server-health-check
```

## Advanced Integration Scenarios

### Multi-Environment Deployment

**Development Environment**:
```json
{
  "mode": "shadow",
  "vault_url": "http://vault-dev:8200",
  "debug": true
}
```

**Staging Environment**:
```json
{
  "mode": "dual", 
  "canary_percent": 50,
  "vault_url": "http://vault-staging:8200",
  "debug": false
}
```

**Production Environment**:
```json
{
  "mode": "vault",
  "canary_percent": 100, 
  "vault_url": "https://vault.production.com:8200",
  "enable_kill_switch": true,
  "debug": false
}
```

### Blue-Green Deployment Integration

```bash
# Blue deployment (current production)
ragnos-vault exec node mcp-server.js  # Using vault

# Green deployment (new version)  
ragnos-vault exec node mcp-server-v2.js  # Same vault integration

# Switch traffic from blue to green
# Vault integration remains consistent across both
```

### A/B Testing with Vault

```json
{
  "mode": "dual",
  "canary_percent": 50,
  "vault_url": "http://vault-a.com:8200"    // 50% to Vault A
  // Remaining 50% uses environment (Vault B secrets)
}
```

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management
- Store `.vault-config.json` in configuration management (Ansible, Terraform)
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Never commit vault tokens to source control
- Use vault token rotation policies

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up alerts for vault hit rate deviations
- Monitor error rates (should remain 0%)
- Alert on kill switch activations
- Track performance regression

### Security Considerations
- Regularly rotate vault tokens
- Monitor audit logs for unauthorized access
- Test emergency fallback procedures monthly  
- Keep environment variables as secure backup

### Performance Optimization
- Tune cache TTL based on secret rotation frequency
- Monitor cache effectiveness (target >2x speedup)
- Consider regional vault deployments for latency
- Load test with expected traffic patterns
